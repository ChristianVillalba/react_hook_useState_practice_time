## Description
This App is a clock: a Heading showing the current time and it updates itself each second (1000 miliseconds).     

The base project was a Heading "Time" and a Button that would change "Time" to show the current time.      
And later It was changed: The heading is the current time and it is updated by itstelf without need to press any button.

## What I have learned with this project:
* Use of Hooks.
* UseState(), a built-in Hook. It returns:
  * Initial Value.
  * Function.
* Destructuring to make our code readable.
* Updating values: how our functions work.
